# Swiss authorities' systemic failures endanger displaced children across decades

Switzerland faces a documented crisis in protecting vulnerable foreign children, with evidence revealing mass disappearances of unaccompanied minors, historic trafficking networks operating with government knowledge, and systematic discrimination against minority children that continues today. A comprehensive investigation into Swiss federal and cantonal authorities' treatment of displaced children from 2020-2025 exposes alarming patterns of institutional failure, with over 1,200 unaccompanied minors vanishing from Swiss asylum centers between 2021-2023 alone, raising serious concerns about trafficking and exploitation.

The February 2025 recognition by the Swiss Federal Council that the forced removal of Yenish and Sinti children constituted a "crime against humanity" under international law marks the first time Switzerland has admitted to committing an international crime. Yet this historic acknowledgment comes amid contemporary evidence suggesting that discriminatory practices and protection failures persist within modern institutional frameworks, affecting Ukrainian refugees, unaccompanied asylum seekers, and minority communities.

## Mass disappearances signal catastrophic protection failure

The most alarming finding concerns the systematic disappearance of unaccompanied minor asylum seekers from Swiss protection systems. **Between 2021 and 2023, 1,226 unaccompanied children vanished from Swiss asylum centers**, according to the Lost in Europe investigation, placing Switzerland fifth highest in Europe for missing migrant children. The crisis accelerated in 2024, with 310 minors disappearing in the first months alone. These disappearances follow a troubling pattern - up to 90% of migrants in some reception centers flee shortly after arrival, suggesting either intolerable conditions or organized trafficking networks accessing vulnerable children.

The scale of disappearances has risen dramatically from 94 missing children in 2015 to 539 in 2016, indicating a worsening crisis. Despite these mass disappearances, Switzerland lacks standard protocols for handling missing children cases and conducts insufficient proactive search efforts. Most disturbingly, discriminatory reporting practices mean migrant children are not reported missing with the same urgency as other children, normalizing their disappearance from state protection.

The National Commission for the Prevention of Torture's 2024 report reveals systemic vulnerabilities enabling these disappearances. **Single specialists are responsible for up to 100 children in some centers**, creating supervision gaps that heighten abuse risks. Combined with poor documentation practices and inadequate staffing, these conditions create an environment where children can vanish without proper investigation or accountability.

## Ukrainian refugee crisis exposes systemic weaknesses

While no evidence emerged of systematic trafficking or targeted mistreatment of Ukrainian refugee children by Swiss authorities, the research reveals significant systemic challenges affecting all vulnerable children in the asylum system. Since activating Protection Status S in March 2022, Switzerland has received over 70,000 Ukrainian refugees, with approximately 66,000 remaining as of 2024. The rapid influx exposed critical capacity issues - the State Secretariat for Migration struggled to find adequate staff, leading to substandard conditions in emergency shelters.

The Federal Commission on Migration reported that emergency shelters, including underground civil defense bunkers, are **incompatible with constitutional and international child protection standards**. These facilities suffer from overcrowding, inadequate violence prevention measures, lack of privacy, and insufficient natural light. The ten-fold increase in unaccompanied minors seeking asylum (from 389 in 2021 to 1,755 in 2022) overwhelmed the system's protective capacity, with girls representing only 43 of the 1,755 unaccompanied minors, raising questions about trafficking of female children.

December 2024's parliamentary decision to restrict Status S eligibility only to those from active war zones or occupied territories introduced new discriminatory elements, potentially separating families based on their specific region of origin within Ukraine. While educational access and healthcare coverage have been provided, employment rates remain low at 23% compared to the 40% target, with significant regional disparities suggesting uneven integration support.

## Historical adoption trafficking networks operated with government knowledge

Investigations into Switzerland's international adoption practices reveal decades of systematic child trafficking operating with government awareness. The Alice Honegger network, active for nearly 50 years, **illegally placed at least 2,000 babies** through coercion, deception, and sometimes outright theft. Despite repeated investigations beginning in 1952, authorities allowed her operations to continue, demonstrating institutional complicity in child trafficking.

Government-commissioned studies confirm the scale of irregularities. **Up to 70% of 750 adoptions from Sri Lanka between the late 1970s and 1990s were illegal**, according to the St. Gallen canton report. A broader ten-country study covering Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, India, Colombia, South Korea, Lebanon, Peru, and Romania found several thousand children affected by trafficking, falsified documents, and missing declarations of origin. The Federal Council acknowledged that Swiss authorities "failed to take appropriate measures against illegal international adoptions" despite awareness of these practices.

The Honegger network's connections extended into intelligence services, with children placed with CIA operatives including founding member Paul Harwood. This international network expanded across North America, creating contacts in multiple countries while Swiss authorities responded only "case-by-case" rather than shutting down operations. The institutional protection afforded to these trafficking networks demonstrates systematic failure at the highest levels of Swiss governance.

## Contemporary trafficking and exploitation continues

Switzerland's current anti-trafficking efforts reveal persistent failures in protecting children. Between 2019 and 2023, authorities identified 295 trafficking victims, with **8% being children** - approximately 24 child victims. However, the Council of Europe's anti-trafficking body GRETA identifies critical gaps including lack of harmonized victim identification procedures across 26 cantons, insufficient specialized assistance for child victims, and no specialized shelters specifically for child trafficking victims.

The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons reports consistently rank Switzerland as **Tier 2**, meaning it does not fully meet minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. Lenient sentencing undermines deterrence - historically, 64% of trafficking convictions result in fines, suspended sentences, or less than one year imprisonment. The emergence of "lover boy" trafficking, where young male traffickers target Swiss girls through fake romantic relationships, represents an evolving threat to Swiss nationals as well as foreign children.

Switzerland serves primarily as a destination country but also functions as a transit route for trafficking networks. Federal Police intelligence indicates approximately 400 Italian mafia members reside in Switzerland, using the country as a "hiding place" for drugs, arms, and human trafficking operations. The connection between organized crime networks from the Balkans, West Africa, and Italian mafia creates a complex web facilitating child exploitation.

## Systematic discrimination against Roma, Sinti, and minority children persists

The Swiss government's February 2025 recognition that forced removal of Yenish and Sinti children constituted a "crime against humanity" acknowledges historical atrocities while contemporary evidence suggests ongoing discrimination. The "Children of the Road" program forcibly removed **600-2,000 Yenish, Sinti, and Manouche children between 1926-1973**, placing them in foster homes, psychiatric hospitals, orphanages, and prisons to "eradicate nomadism at its source."

Today, while Yenish and Sinti are recognized as national minorities, **Roma recognition was denied in 2018** despite 80,000-100,000 Roma living in Switzerland. The European Court of Human Rights unanimously found Switzerland violated anti-discrimination provisions through ethnic profiling in the 2024 *Wa Baile v Switzerland* case. Contemporary issues include severe shortages of adequate camping sites for traveling communities, with two-thirds of existing sites inadequate, persistent discrimination in housing and employment, and police ethnic profiling confirmed by international courts.

The Child and Adult Protection Agency (KESB) recorded a 6.5% increase in child cases in 2023, the highest ever annual increase. While specific statistics are unavailable due to Switzerland's failure to collect systematic discrimination data, evidence suggests minority children may be overrepresented in child protection cases. The UN Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination criticized Switzerland's lack of general anti-discrimination legislation and absence of data collection preventing systematic monitoring of discrimination.

## Institutional networks protect perpetrators while silencing whistleblowers

Perhaps most damaging to child protection efforts is **Switzerland's complete lack of federal whistleblower protection**. The National Council definitively rejected whistleblower protection law in 2020 after multiple failed attempts between 2003-2020. Switzerland remains among the minority of European countries with no federal protection, meaning whistleblowers face dismissals, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, and harassment for reporting wrongdoing.

The OECD expressed being "highly concerned" about Switzerland's lack of whistleblower law in 2022, identifying an "intelligence system" between financiers, companies, judges, and lawyers that suppresses accountability. This systematic silencing prevents exposure of abuse within child protection systems. Banking secrecy laws mean whistleblowers can be held criminally liable for exposing financial crimes connected to trafficking.

UN monitoring reveals systematic failures across child protection. The Committee on the Rights of the Child issued **138 specific recommendations** to Switzerland in 2021, identifying de facto discrimination against disadvantaged children, inadequate protection for refugee and migrant children, gaps in monitoring systems, and lack of coordination between federal and cantonal levels. Despite these international interventions, parliamentary oversight remains limited - only four parliamentary inquiry committees have been established in Swiss history, with none addressing child welfare scandals despite documented evidence.

## Jurisdictional complexity enables protection gaps

The research reveals how Switzerland's federal structure creates critical protection gaps. With 26 cantons having varying procedures, staffing, and funding levels, only six cantons maintain specialized anti-trafficking police units. This fragmentation prevents effective responses to organized trafficking networks operating across jurisdictions. Smaller cantons lack resources for complex investigations, while coordination failures between federal centers and cantonal KESB authorities create jurisdictional gaps exploited by traffickers.

The asylum system's division of responsibilities proves particularly problematic. Children transferred from federal to cantonal systems encounter varying quality standards, with some placed in foster care when parents are detained, raising family separation concerns. Complex jurisdictional boundaries, combined with inadequate documentation of abuse allegations, create an environment where accountability becomes nearly impossible to establish.

## Detention and institutional conditions violate international standards

Switzerland's practice of detaining minors aged 15-18 for up to 12 months for immigration purposes drew criticism from the UN Committee Against Torture. Between 2018-2024, hundreds of minors were detained annually, mostly in inappropriate prison facilities rather than specialized centers. Terre des Hommes labeled detention conditions "unacceptable," increasing abuse risks for vulnerable children.

Emergency accommodation frequently relies on overcrowded facilities and underground bomb shelters lacking natural light, proper ventilation, and privacy. The normalization of adverse care practices, combined with social stigmatization and discrimination, creates environments incompatible with children's rights. Resource shortages and poor working conditions for caregivers compound these failures, while lack of oversight by authorities enables continuation of harmful practices.

## International pressure mounts for comprehensive reform

Multiple international bodies have identified Switzerland's child protection failures. The Council of Europe's various monitoring mechanisms, including GRETA, ECRI, and the Lanzarote Committee, consistently highlight gaps in protecting vulnerable children. The European Committee for Prevention of Torture conducts regular visits assessing children in detention, while the Commissioner for Human Rights called for ending child detention at Swiss airports, stating "Children, with or without their families, do not belong in detention."

Civil society documentation adds crucial evidence. The Swiss Platform Against Human Trafficking recorded 197 victims in 2023, an 11% increase from 2022, assisting 488 people total from 55 countries. Geographic distribution shows 56% from Africa, 17% Europe, 14% Latin America, and 12% Asia, demonstrating the global nature of trafficking networks exploiting Switzerland's protection gaps.

## Conclusion

The evidence reveals Switzerland's systematic failure to protect displaced and vulnerable foreign children spans decades and continues today. From mass disappearances of unaccompanied minors to historic trafficking networks operating with government knowledge, from ongoing discrimination against minority children to the complete absence of whistleblower protection, the patterns demonstrate institutional failures at every level. The February 2025 recognition of crimes against humanity regarding forced child removals, while historic, appears insufficient given contemporary evidence of ongoing protection failures. Without comprehensive reform addressing jurisdictional gaps, resource constraints, discrimination, and institutional accountability, Switzerland's most vulnerable children remain at risk of trafficking, exploitation, and disappearance from state protection systems designed to safeguard them.
