# Switzerland's paradox: Strong press culture meets criminal law constraints

Switzerland presents a striking contradiction in press freedom - a country with strong democratic traditions and constitutional protections for media that simultaneously maintains some of the most restrictive criminal laws affecting journalism in the democratic world. While ranking 9th globally in the 2025 Press Freedom Index, Switzerland's **legal framework ranks only 27th internationally**, revealing a critical gap between cultural respect for journalism and the laws that govern it.

The core issue centers on Article 47 of the Swiss Banking Act, which criminalizes publishing confidential banking information with penalties up to 5 years imprisonment and CHF 250,000 fines - even when exposing criminal activity in the public interest. This law, **unique among democratic nations**, led to the first criminal prosecution of a journalist in 2024 when police raided financial blogger Lukas Hässig's home and office. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan condemned this as "an example of the criminalization of journalism" typically seen in authoritarian states. The law's chilling effect forced Swiss media to withdraw from major international investigations like "Suisse Secrets," isolating Swiss journalists from global anti-corruption efforts.

## Criminal laws that threaten Swiss journalism

Switzerland's criminal code contains multiple provisions that can lead to prosecution of journalists, creating a legal minefield for investigative reporting. The most problematic areas involve defamation, official secrecy, and especially banking confidentiality.

**Defamation laws (Articles 173-177)** criminalize damaging someone's reputation, with penalties ranging from 180 daily fines for defamation to 3 years imprisonment for slander. While journalists can defend themselves by proving allegations are true and in the public interest, this defense explicitly excludes private or family matters. Recent convictions include journalists fined CHF 13,200 for suggesting possible "extortion" without giving the subject opportunity to respond. Unlike many European countries, Switzerland provides no special protections for journalists facing defamation charges - they're treated identically to ordinary citizens.

**Official and professional secrecy provisions** create additional barriers. Article 293 criminalizes publishing secret official proceedings, while Article 320 punishes breach of official secrecy with up to 3 years imprisonment. These provisions continue to apply even after employment ends, unless disclosure receives written superior approval. Article 321 extends similar restrictions to professional secrecy violations, affecting journalists who receive information from lawyers, doctors, or other professionals bound by confidentiality.

The **2022 tightening of "provisional measures"** further constrains press freedom by making it easier for subjects to obtain pre-publication injunctions. Parliament lowered the threshold from requiring proof of "extraordinarily serious disadvantage" to merely "serious disadvantage," expanding judicial powers to block journalistic content before publication. This change, identified by Reporters Without Borders as problematic, increases the risk of prior censorship through legal threats.

## Recent prosecutions reveal enforcement escalation

The theoretical risks of Switzerland's press laws became stark reality in 2024 with the **first criminal prosecution under banking secrecy laws**. Lukas Hässig, founder of financial blog Inside Paradeplatz, faces investigation for his 2016 reporting on Raiffeisen Bank executives who were later convicted of fraud. Despite his journalism exposing genuine criminal activity, prosecutors authorized raids seizing his laptop, phone, and documents. The International Press Institute condemned this as "one of the gravest threats to media freedom in Switzerland in recent years."

Other significant cases demonstrate the breadth of legal threats facing Swiss journalists. In the **Nina Jecker case (2014)**, the Federal Court forced a Basler Zeitung reporter to reveal her source in a drug trafficking investigation initiated solely based on her article. While the European Court of Human Rights later found Switzerland violated press freedom, the domestic precedent remains concerning. The case highlighted Switzerland's limited source protection compared to European standards.

**Self-censorship has become the practical response** to legal risks. When the international consortium investigated Credit Suisse's corrupt clients in 2022's "Suisse Secrets" project, major Swiss outlet Tamedia withdrew entirely due to prosecution fears under Article 47. This withdrawal sent what industry leaders called "a bad signal towards the banks, which may feel empowered" to continue questionable practices without scrutiny. The chilling effect extends beyond Switzerland - international journalists increasingly avoid traveling to the country when working on financial investigations.

Criminal defamation prosecutions continue regularly, though with more modest penalties. Journalist Bruno Hug received CHF 13,200 in fines for suggesting possible criminal activity without adequate right of reply. Courts have even extended defamation liability to social media, ruling that "liking" defamatory Facebook posts constitutes criminal endorsement. While individual penalties remain relatively small, the cumulative effect creates a culture of caution around critical reporting.

## Switzerland lags behind European press freedom standards

International comparisons reveal Switzerland's unique position among democracies in criminalizing financial journalism. While the country maintains respectable overall press freedom rankings - 9th globally in 2025 - its **legal framework significantly trails European leaders**. Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden, and Denmark consistently outrank Switzerland, combining strong constitutional protections with journalist-friendly legal frameworks.

The banking secrecy provision stands as Switzerland's most glaring departure from international norms. **No other major democracy criminalizes publishing accurate banking information** when it serves the public interest by exposing corruption or crime. Germany, France, the UK, and Nordic countries all provide explicit or implicit public interest defenses for such journalism. The UN Special Rapporteur noted this makes Switzerland an outlier, with laws that "violate human rights" and create censorship typically associated with authoritarian regimes.

Source protection represents another area where Switzerland falls short. While Article 28a provides some protection for periodical journalists, the framework remains narrower than European best practices. The Nina Jecker case demonstrated how easily courts can compel source disclosure when balanced against law enforcement interests. By contrast, Nordic countries maintain much stronger journalist privilege laws, while Germany provides more comprehensive protections across all media workers.

Even in areas where Switzerland aligns with European practices, such as maintaining criminal defamation laws (retained by 23 of 28 EU countries), the implementation proves more restrictive. Many European countries provide stronger public interest defenses or special considerations for journalists that Switzerland lacks. The 2022 tightening of provisional measures moved Switzerland further from European standards requiring narrow interpretation of publication restrictions under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

## Specific Criminal Code articles restricting press freedom

The Swiss Criminal Code contains numerous provisions that directly impact journalistic work, creating a complex web of potential criminal liability. Understanding these specific articles reveals how thoroughly Swiss law constrains investigative reporting.

**Articles 173-174 on defamation and slander** remain the most commonly prosecuted offenses against journalists. Article 173 criminalizes accusing someone of "dishonorable conduct" or making statements that damage reputation, while Article 174 covers knowingly false allegations. The **key limitation**: even truthful reporting loses protection when it concerns "private or family life" without clear public interest. Courts interpret this broadly, leaving journalists vulnerable when reporting on public figures' conduct that intersects with personal matters.

**Article 293's prohibition on publishing secret official proceedings** creates particular challenges for political and investigative reporters. The provision covers not just classified documents but any information from proceedings authorities deem confidential. Unlike some countries providing whistleblower or public interest exceptions, Swiss law offers no escape clause - publication itself constitutes the crime regardless of content significance or public benefit.

**Article 320 on official secrecy** extends criminal liability indefinitely. Former government employees cannot disclose information learned through official positions without written superior authorization, even decades after leaving service. This provision effectively blocks insider sources from revealing government wrongdoing to journalists, who face prosecution as accomplices for receiving such information. The law's breadth covers not just state secrets but any information authorities consider confidential.

**Article 47 of the Banking Act** represents the most extreme restriction. The 2015 amendment explicitly extended criminal liability to third parties including journalists, closing previous ambiguities. The law criminalizes revealing even the existence of a Swiss bank account, let alone transaction details or evidence of criminal activity. With penalties up to 5 years imprisonment and CHF 250,000 fines, this provision imposes **the harshest punishment for financial journalism found in any democracy**.

The interaction between these provisions creates compounding risks. A single investigation might trigger liability under banking secrecy, official secrecy, and defamation laws simultaneously. The absence of public interest defenses across these statutes means journalists cannot justify publication based on exposing corruption, protecting public safety, or serving democratic accountability.

## Press freedom organizations condemn Swiss restrictions

International press freedom organizations have issued increasingly sharp criticism of Switzerland's legal framework, particularly following the 2024 criminal prosecution of journalist Lukas Hässig. Their assessments reveal how Switzerland's approach violates international standards and democratic norms.

**Reporters Without Borders** currently ranks Switzerland 9th globally but notes significant legal framework weaknesses. The organization specifically criticized the 2022 tightening of provisional measures allowing easier pre-publication injunctions. Swiss section representative Denis Masmejan called applying banking secrecy to media "absurd and incompatible with the freedom of the press." The organization views Switzerland's trajectory as concerning - while maintaining high security scores for journalist safety, legal restrictions create "a less favorable political climate than in the past."

The **UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, Irene Khan**, delivered the harshest criticism, calling Article 47 "an example of the criminalization of journalism" that "paralyses freedom of expression and media freedom." In formal communications to the Swiss government, she emphasized that the banking law "violates human rights" by lacking explicit exemptions for journalists and whistleblowers. Her assessment that such restrictions belong in "authoritarian states" rather than democracies represents unprecedented UN criticism of Swiss press laws.

The **International Press Institute** labeled Switzerland's banking secrecy laws "draconian" and called for urgent reform. IPI emphasized how the lack of public interest provisions "allows the Swiss Banking Act to be misused to criminalize legitimate, public-interest journalism." The organization particularly noted the global implications - Swiss laws don't just affect domestic journalists but create risks for international reporters investigating Swiss banks' role in global corruption.

**OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Teresa Ribeiro** characterized the banking law's effect as creating "prior-censorship" through self-censorship, stating this is "normally a problem in authoritarian states." She stressed that "under international law, journalists have the right to write about matters of public interest" and that media must fulfill their "fundamental role to act as society's watchdog."

Swiss press organizations echo international concerns. **Impressum**, the Swiss journalists' association, declared that "one of democracy's fundamental pillars is under attack" and requested government action to "reverse these trends by reinforcing press freedom." The organization particularly highlighted how legal threats create an atmosphere encouraging self-censorship beyond formal prosecutions.

## Balancing press freedom with privacy and state interests

Swiss law ostensibly balances press freedom against competing interests like privacy, reputation, and state security, but critics argue the scales tip heavily against journalism. The constitutional framework appears robust - Article 17 explicitly guarantees press freedom and source protection - yet implementation through criminal law undermines these protections.

The **privacy versus public interest calculation** particularly disadvantages journalists. While many democracies recognize that public figures accept reduced privacy expectations, Swiss courts maintain strict protection even for prominent individuals' private matters. The absence of a clear "public figure doctrine" means journalists risk prosecution for reporting on powerful individuals' conduct even when it affects their public roles or involves abuse of position.

**State security justifications** for restricting press freedom prove especially problematic given Switzerland's broad interpretation. Article 293's prohibition on publishing secret proceedings applies not just to genuine security matters but to any information authorities designate confidential. This allows officials to criminalize embarrassing revelations by simply classifying the information. Without requiring authorities to demonstrate actual security harm or providing judicial review of classification decisions, the system invites abuse.

The **banking secrecy absolutism** represents the starkest imbalance. While other countries recognize that financial privacy must yield to exposing money laundering, tax evasion, or corruption, Swiss law maintains banking confidentiality as nearly sacrosanct. Even when journalists uncover evidence of serious crimes - as in the Hässig case where reported individuals were later convicted - the act of publication itself remains criminal. This prioritizes institutional reputation over public interest in combating financial crime.

Recent legislative changes have **worsened rather than improved** these imbalances. The 2022 provisional measures reform made it easier to obtain pre-publication injunctions by lowering the harm threshold required. Multiple attempts to introduce public interest defenses or whistleblower protections failed in parliament during 2019-2023, with lawmakers claiming "no need for legislative action" despite international criticism.

The practical effect creates what critics call a **"chilling effect" ecosystem** where journalists self-censor to avoid legal risks. When Tamedia withdrew from the Suisse Secrets investigation, it demonstrated how theoretical legal threats translate into real journalism restrictions. Sources become reluctant to approach journalists knowing both could face prosecution. International reporters avoid Swiss stories or travel to Switzerland when investigating financial crimes.

## Recent legislative changes worsen press protections

The legislative trajectory from 2020-2025 reveals a troubling pattern: rather than addressing international criticism, Swiss lawmakers have further restricted press freedom while blocking reform attempts. This period marked a shift from theoretical legal threats to active criminal prosecution of journalists.

The **2022 tightening of provisional measures** stands as the most significant recent restriction. By removing the word "extraordinarily" from the standard required for pre-publication injunctions, parliament made it substantially easier for subjects of journalistic investigation to block publication. Previously, applicants needed to prove "extraordinarily serious disadvantage" - now merely "serious disadvantage" suffices. Reporters Without Borders identified this change as particularly problematic for investigative journalism, where subjects routinely claim potential harm to prevent exposure of wrongdoing.

**Failed whistleblower protection efforts** in 2019 and 2020 demonstrated parliamentary resistance to press freedom reforms. The Federal Council's proposal for "Protection in the event of reporting irregularities in the workplace" faced rejection twice by the National Council. This leaves Switzerland as one of the few European countries without national whistleblower protections, forcing sources to risk criminal prosecution when exposing wrongdoing. The OECD specifically criticized Switzerland's failure to implement Anti-Bribery Convention recommendations in this area.

The **2024 escalation to criminal prosecution** under banking secrecy laws marked a watershed moment. While Article 47 existed since 2015, authorities had not previously prosecuted journalists for publication. The decision to raid Lukas Hässig's home and office - for reporting on bankers later convicted of fraud - signals a new enforcement approach. This first prosecution triggered international condemnation and demonstrated that theoretical legal threats have become practical reality.

**Parliamentary rejection of banking law reform** in 2022 and 2023 revealed political obstacles to change. Despite UN Special Rapporteur criticism and international pressure, committee majorities stated they saw "no need for legislative action." Some lawmakers even proposed strengthening banking secrecy rather than creating journalism exceptions. The 2023 electoral shift rightward, with the Swiss People's Party gaining 9 seats, suggests reform prospects remain dim for the current legislative period.

Even **positive transparency developments** proved limited. While the 2022 political party financing law improved electoral transparency, it didn't address journalism restrictions. Canton-level improvements in government transparency and whistleblowing procedures apply only to public sector employees, leaving private sector corruption largely shielded from exposure.

## International community demands urgent Swiss reforms

The international criticism of Switzerland's press freedom restrictions has reached unprecedented levels, with UN officials, European institutions, and press freedom organizations united in condemning the criminalization of journalism. Their specific recommendations provide a roadmap for necessary reforms.

**UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan** leads the criticism, formally communicating to the Swiss government that Article 47 "violates human rights" and represents criminalization "normally seen in authoritarian states." Her specific recommendations include creating explicit public interest exemptions for journalists reporting on financial crimes, establishing robust whistleblower protections, and aligning banking secrecy laws with international human rights standards. She particularly emphasized eliminating laws creating "chilling effects" that lead to self-censorship.

The **OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media** stressed that Switzerland must honor its commitments to media freedom by ensuring journalists can fulfill their democratic watchdog function. The OSCE specifically called for removing criminal penalties for public interest journalism and aligning Swiss practice with other democratic OSCE member states. Teresa Ribeiro's characterization of Swiss law as creating "prior-censorship" typically found in authoritarian systems represents unusually sharp criticism from this diplomatic body.

**European institutions** have highlighted Switzerland's departure from continental standards. While not an EU member, Switzerland's banking secrecy approach contrasts starkly with EU efforts to enhance financial transparency and protect investigative journalism through anti-SLAPP initiatives. The Council of Europe's Platform for the Protection of Journalism documented Switzerland's challenges, noting violations of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

**International press freedom organizations** united in calling for urgent reform. The International Press Institute demanded creation of public interest defenses in banking law, while Reporters Without Borders insisted Switzerland must reverse the 2022 provisional measures tightening. The European Federation of Journalists stated bluntly that "Switzerland simply does not respect European legal standards on freedom of expression."

Academic legal experts and foreign governments have added their criticism. The U.S. Helsinki Commission called Switzerland "a leading enabler" of financial crimes through laws criminalizing exposure of wrongdoing. International legal scholars note Switzerland's banking secrecy provisions remain **unique among democracies** in criminalizing accurate reporting on financial crimes without public interest considerations.

The consensus recommendations focus on specific legislative reforms: amending Article 47 to include robust public interest exceptions, strengthening constitutional press freedom protections to override ordinary criminal law, implementing comprehensive whistleblower protections, and reversing the 2022 provisional measures restrictions. Without these changes, Switzerland risks further international isolation as a country prioritizing institutional secrecy over democratic transparency.

## Conclusion

Switzerland's approach to press freedom embodies a fundamental contradiction that undermines its democratic credentials. While maintaining strong cultural respect for journalism and constitutional guarantees of press freedom, the country simultaneously enforces **criminal laws that would be inconceivable in most democracies**. The first criminal prosecution of a journalist under banking secrecy laws in 2024 transformed theoretical concerns into practical reality, validating years of international criticism.

The evidence reveals three critical failures in Swiss press law. First, Article 47 of the Banking Act creates an unprecedented criminalization of financial journalism, forcing Swiss media to withdraw from international investigations and creating what the UN Special Rapporteur called a "chilling effect" amounting to censorship. Second, the absence of meaningful public interest defenses across defamation, secrecy, and banking laws leaves journalists vulnerable to prosecution for exposing corruption or wrongdoing. Third, recent legislative changes have worsened rather than improved these restrictions, with parliament rejecting reform attempts while making it easier to obtain pre-publication injunctions.

The international consensus is unequivocal: Switzerland must urgently reform its press laws to meet democratic standards. The specific path forward requires amending the Banking Act to include robust public interest exceptions, implementing comprehensive whistleblower protections, and strengthening source protection to match European best practices. Without these reforms, Switzerland will continue to be viewed as prioritizing banking secrecy and institutional reputation over the transparency and accountability essential to democratic governance. The gap between Switzerland's democratic ideals and its legal reality represents not just a domestic concern but a threat to global efforts to combat financial crime through investigative journalism.
